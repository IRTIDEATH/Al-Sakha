# Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides information about my personal web portfolio, which showcases my skills, experience, and services as a web developer.

## Design Philosophy

The *Irtideath* website embraces a philosophy of **warm minimalism**, inspired by the quiet comfort of a cat taking a nap. Its calm color palette—soft grays with coffee-toned accents—creates a soothing, welcoming atmosphere.

Simple typography and generous white space offer visual breathing room, reflecting clarity and peace. The casual, honest writing style builds a sincere connection between the creator and the visitor.

Every element—from color to layout to words—embodies a personality that is humble, open, and introspective. This isn’t just a portfolio—it’s an invitation to quietly get to know someone through design that speaks without shouting.
